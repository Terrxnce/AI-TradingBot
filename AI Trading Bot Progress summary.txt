📘 AI Trading Bot – Initial Setup Summary
📅 Setup Date: June 2, 2025
🛠️ Objective: Build a fully autonomous trading system using local AI (LLaMA 3), technical signals, and automated execution — completely offline and free of paid APIs.

🧱 Environment & Tools
Component	Status	Notes
Python venv	✅	tradingbot_env – clean, isolated setup
Code Editor	✅	Visual Studio Code with Python configured
Broker	✅	MetaTrader 5 (MT5) live and functional
AI Reasoning	✅	LLaMA 3 via Ollama (local, no API costs)
News Feed	✅	Live headlines fetched via NewsAPI

🔧 Core Modules (as of June 2)
File Name	Purpose
test_setup.py	Verifies MT5, NewsAPI, and LLaMA 3 are connected
get_candles.py	Pulls live OHLCV data from MT5 as DataFrame
strategy_engine.py	Detects Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, EMA trend, BOS, sweeps
run_strategy_test.py	Runs strategy logic on live chart data for testing

🧠 Local AI Setup
Component	Detail
Model	LLaMA 3 via Ollama
Endpoint	http://localhost:11434
Method	requests.post() for prompts
Role	Interprets macro bias & confirms TA direction
Cost	❌ Free & offline-only

📌 Original Roadmap
Step	Module	Goal
1️⃣	decision_engine.py	Merge TA output with LLaMA sentiment
2️⃣	broker_interface.py	Place trades via MT5 using order_send()
3️⃣	bot_runner.py	Automate loop: fetch → analyze → trade
4️⃣	journal_logger.py	Track trades and performance (optional)
5️⃣	plot_viewer.py	Visual OB/FVG/BOS zones (optional)

✅ Summary (as of June 2)
MT5 data pipeline was live and reliable

Local LLaMA 3 model responded with valid sentiment

TA engine successfully detected OB, FVG, BOS, and EMA trends

Offline-compatible, scalable architecture built and verified

📘 AI Trading Bot – Progress Update
📅 Date: July 1, 2025
🚀 Milestone: First fully autonomous trade executed using combined TA + AI logic

🔄 What’s New Since June 2
Component	Status	Update Summary
decision_engine.py	✅	Fuses TA + AI. Strong technicals (score ≥ 5) override weak AI sentiment.
broker_interface.py	✅	Places MT5 trades with dynamic or static SL/TP, handles Market Watch symbols.
bot_runner.py	✅	15-minute loop: fetch → analyze → reason → decide → execute.
Dynamic SL/TP Logic	✅	ATR-based adaptive targets for smarter risk control.
Symbol Resolver	✅	Handles .r, _pro, and other broker suffixes.
AI Confidence Parsing	✅	Extracts sentiment strength from LLaMA output.
TA Override Logic	✅	Allows trades when TA is extremely strong even if AI is cautious.

🧪 First Live Trade Example
Symbol: AUDUSD

EMA Trend: Bullish (21 > 50 > 200)

TA Signals: BOS, OB Tap, FVG, Rejection, Engulfing, False Break

AI Output: "Bullish with high confidence based on technicals"

Action Taken: BUY AUDUSD @ 0.65808

SL/TP: Auto-generated → SL: 0.65562 | TP: 0.66234

✅ Trade Executed Successfully via MT5

🧱 System Status (Current)
Component	Status	Notes
MT5 Integration	✅	Stable and live, trades confirmed
LLaMA 3 (Ollama)	✅	Local reasoning works without delay
NewsAPI	✅	Integrated, but not yet included in AI reasoning
Technical Engine	✅	OB/FVG/BOS/EMA detection fully functional
Automation Loop	✅	bot_runner.py runs every 15 minutes

🧠 Decision Logic Overview
TA Signals → Score → Direction → AI Confirmation → Trade Decision
                              ↓
                Score ≥ 5 → Ignore AI → Trade on Trend

📁 Current File Overview
File Name	Purpose
decision_engine.py	Merges TA and AI signals to determine trade direction
broker_interface.py	Executes trades, calculates/falls back on SL/TP
strategy_engine.py	Core TA logic: FVG, OB, BOS, EMA, Liquidity Sweeps
get_candles.py	Retrieves 15-min candles from MT5
bot_runner.py	Orchestrates full loop every 15 mins
config.py	Central settings: pip distance, trend sensitivity
journal_logger.py	(Planned) Logs all trades for review

🧭 Suggested Next Steps
Priority	Module	Task
🟢 High	journal_logger.py	Log each trade: entry, SL, TP, reasoning, result
🟡 Med	AI Upgrade	Let LLaMA suggest direction — not just confirm TA
🟡 Med	News Fusion	Integrate macro sentiment from NewsAPI into AI prompts
⚪ Low	Multi-symbol Mode	Expand bot to 3–5 FX pairs concurrently
⚪ Low	GUI Dashboard	Add web/desktop interface for real-time bot status
