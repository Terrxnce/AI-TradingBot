## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### News Protection System Test Results
```
✅ Configuration: News protection enabled, ±30 minute window
✅ Currency Extraction: All major pairs correctly identified
✅ News Data Loading: Successfully loaded 5 high-impact events
✅ Protection Logic: Correctly blocks trades within ±30 minute window
✅ Edge Cases: Handles empty events, invalid dates, boundary conditions
✅ Currency Matching: USD events block USDJPY and EURUSD correctly
✅ Time Windows: Events outside ±30 minutes don't block trading
```

### Key Test Scenarios Verified
1. **Future Event Blocking**: USD event 15 minutes from now blocks USDJPY and EURUSD
2. **Past Event Blocking**: EUR event 15 minutes ago blocks EURUSD and EURJPY
3. **Boundary Testing**: Event exactly at ±30 minute boundary correctly blocks
4. **Currency Matching**: Only relevant currency pairs are blocked
5. **Time Window**: Events outside ±30 minutes don't block trading
6. **Error Handling**: Invalid dates and empty event lists handled gracefully
