# 📦 D.E.V.I Bot Enhancements - Implementation Summary

**Submitted by:** Terry Ndifor  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-26  
**Target Bot:** D.E.V.I (Live Trading Bot)  

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 🧩 Feature 1 – Raise Base Technical Score Requirement to 6.0

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `config.py`: Changed `min_score_for_trade` from 4.5 to 6.0
- Updated `decision_engine.py`: 
  - Fixed default fallback from 4.5 to 6.0
  - Added explicit score check that blocks trades below 6.0
  - Updated technical override threshold to use config value instead of hardcoded 5
- All score comparisons now consistently use the 6.0 threshold

**Result:** Trades will only execute if technical_score ≥ 6.0, improving trade selectivity.

### 🧩 Feature 2 – Auto-Close All Trades at 4:00 PM Daily

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Changes Made:**
- Added `close_all_positions()` function to `position_manager.py`
- Added `close_trades_at_4pm()` function to `position_manager.py` 
- Integrated the 4 PM check into the main bot loop in `bot_runner.py`
- Function automatically detects when it's 16:00 (4:00 PM) and force-closes all positions

**Result:** All open trades are automatically closed daily at 4:00 PM to avoid late session volatility.

### 🧩 Feature 3 – No New Trades if Unrealized PnL < -1%

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Changes Made:**
- Created `loss_block_state.json` file to track drawdown state
- Added `check_pnl_drawdown_block()` function to `risk_guard.py`
- Integrated the check into the main `can_trade()` function
- Function calculates -1% of balance and blocks trades when floating PnL drops below this threshold

**Result:** New trades are blocked when unrealized PnL falls below -1% of account balance.

---

### 🧩 Feature 4 – Resume Trading Only When PnL > 0

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Changes Made:**
- Added persistent state management via `loss_block_state.json`
- Added `load_loss_block_state()` and `set_loss_block_state()` functions
- Implemented recovery logic that only resumes trading when floating PnL becomes positive
- State persists across bot restarts

**Result:** Once the -1% drawdown trigger is hit, trading remains blocked until floating PnL recovers above $0.
